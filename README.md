## dN/dS analysis

| Figure 1   | dN/dS values of protein families of ten Colletotrichum genomes (five Ct and five Cpatho samples) by category. Families are grouped into 331 putative CSEP protein families and 3234 SSP families. A significant enrichment of large dN/dS values was observed for the CSEP protein families in comparison to other protein families (one-sided Fisher's exact test, p-value < 2.2e-16).|    |
| Figure 2  | Distribution of dn/dS ratios for the protein families of the ten Colletotrichum genomes (Ct and Cpatho samples). The ratio of synonymous mutations per synonymous sites versus non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous sites (dn/dS) is shown for 13458 protein families identified with OrthoMCL. A high ratio indicates evidence for positive selection. |    |
| Figure 3 | dn/dS ratios for protein families of the ten Colletotrichum genomes grouped by fuNOG annotation on the most general level. Ratio of synonymous mutations per synonymous sites versus non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous sites (dn/dS) for 13458 protein families identified with OrthoMCL grouped into three fuNOG categories. A high ratio indicates evidence for positive selection. Putative CSEP protein families in the “Cellular processes and signalling” fuNOG group showed a significantly higher dn/dS ratio compared to all protein families in this fuNOG group.|    |
