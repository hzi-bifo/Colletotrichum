| Fig. 3b | CSEP gene families with evidence of positive selection (grey line: p=0.05) in five pathogenic Colletotrichum species (left) compared to five C. tofieldiae isolates (right). The CSEPs that are shared or unique to each set are highlighted in red and blue, respectively.|[link](figures/fig_3b)|
| Supplementary Fig. 6 | dN/dS ratios of protein families from the ten Colletotrichum genomes grouped by fuNOG annotation on the second level (lvl2) and ordered by descending median dn/dS ratio.|[link](figures/fig_s_6)|
| Supplementary Fig. 7 | Second-level fuNOG functional categories (lvl2) showing significant evidence of positive selection in the genomes of pathogenic Colletotrichum vs. C. tofieldiae isolates (a) and vice versa (b).|figures/fig_s_7|
